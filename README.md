# Image Restoration Project
 
Image restoration comparison for median, mean, bilateral, min and max filters using Peak-Signal-to-Noise ratio (PSNR) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as comparison metrics.

Comparison was done for both Gaussian noise and Impulse Noise (Salt & Pepper). 

Project was done on Google Colab. 
 
Images used are from the Stanford Dogs image dataset: http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/
